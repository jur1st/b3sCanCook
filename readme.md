# Welcome to b3s Can Cook

## What's this?

It's a collaborative cookbook produced by what was at one time a liberal arts society focused on web design. Now it's mostly food or if it's not, just wait and it will be about food.

## I like food, how can I help?

Just use the handy template to type up your recipe and add some images to it.

## Can I do this in a nerdier way?

Absolutely, and it's what would be preferred. Clone the cookbook from GitHub, add your recipes, and submit a pull request.

## What will the final product look like?

Not sure yet, but we'll figure something out. Having everything in Markdown format gives us a pile of options.
